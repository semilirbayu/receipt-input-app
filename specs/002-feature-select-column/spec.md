# Feature Specification: Column Mapping Configuration

**Feature Branch**: `002-feature-select-column`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "feature select column

when user setting google spreadsheet, I want capability for user to specify which column a data will be placed. for example date data will be placed in Column B, desc data will be placed in Column C, price data will be placed in Column F"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: When a user first sets up the spreadsheet integration, what should happen with column mappings? ‚Üí A: Require users to explicitly configure all column mappings before they can process any receipts
- Q: Should the system allow users to assign multiple data fields to the same column (e.g., both Date and Price to Column B)? ‚Üí A: Allow it silently - concatenate or merge values in the same cell
- Q: Can users map receipt data to non-contiguous columns (e.g., Date‚ÜíA, Description‚ÜíC, Price‚ÜíF, skipping B, D, E)? ‚Üí A: Yes, any columns allowed - full flexibility
- Q: What happens to existing receipt data in the spreadsheet when a user changes their column mappings? ‚Üí A: Leave existing data unchanged - only new receipts use new mappings
- Q: What is the maximum column limit the system should validate against (e.g., Google Sheets supports columns A-ZZZ = 18,278 columns)? ‚Üí A: Practical limit for usability (702 columns / A-ZZ)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a user configures their Google Spreadsheet integration for receipt data, they need the flexibility to choose which specific columns will store each type of extracted data (date, description, price). This allows users to adapt the application to their existing spreadsheet structures rather than being forced to reorganize their sheets to match a predetermined column layout.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is configuring Google Spreadsheet settings, **When** they specify column mappings (e.g., Date ‚Üí Column B, Description ‚Üí Column C, Price ‚Üí Column F), **Then** the system saves these column preferences for future receipt data entries

2. **Given** column mappings are configured, **When** a receipt is processed and data is extracted, **Then** each data field is written to its designated column in the spreadsheet

3. **Given** a user wants to modify their column mappings, **When** they access the spreadsheet settings, **Then** they can view current mappings and update them to different columns

5. **Given** a user changes their column mappings after previously processing receipts, **When** they process new receipts, **Then** the new receipts are written to the updated column locations while existing receipt data remains in the original columns unchanged

4. **Given** a user is setting up the spreadsheet integration for the first time, **When** they attempt to process a receipt without configuring column mappings, **Then** the system blocks the operation and prompts them to configure all required column mappings (date, description, price) first

### Edge Cases
- When a user assigns multiple data fields to the same column (e.g., Date and Price both to Column B), the system concatenates or merges the values into the same cell
- Users can map to any columns including non-contiguous ones (e.g., Date‚ÜíA, Description‚ÜíC, Price‚ÜíF, leaving B, D, E empty)
- When column mappings are changed, existing receipt data in the spreadsheet remains in its original column locations; only newly processed receipts use the updated mappings
- When a user specifies an invalid column reference beyond Column ZZ (e.g., Column AAA), the system rejects it and displays a validation error
- Column references must be within the range A-ZZ (702 columns maximum) for practical usability
- What happens when a user tries to map data to columns that already contain other data or headers? (Deferred to implementation - system writes to specified columns regardless of existing content)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to specify column assignments for each receipt data field (date, description, price) to any column, including non-contiguous selections
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept column specifications in standard spreadsheet notation (Column A, Column B, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist column mapping preferences between sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply saved column mappings when writing receipt data to the spreadsheet
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to view their current column mapping configuration
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to modify existing column mappings
- **FR-014**: System MUST NOT migrate or modify existing receipt data when column mappings are changed
- **FR-015**: System MUST apply updated column mappings only to newly processed receipts after a mapping change
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate column references to ensure they are within the range A-ZZ (702 columns maximum)
- **FR-016**: System MUST reject column references beyond Column ZZ and display a validation error message
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to assign multiple data fields to the same column
- **FR-013**: System MUST concatenate or merge multiple data field values when they are mapped to the same column
- **FR-009**: System MUST require users to explicitly configure all column mappings (date, description, price) before allowing any receipt processing
- **FR-011**: System MUST block receipt processing operations when column mappings are incomplete or missing
- **FR-012**: System MUST display a clear prompt directing users to configure column mappings when they attempt to process receipts without completing configuration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Column Mapping Configuration**: Represents the user's preferences for which spreadsheet columns correspond to which receipt data fields. Contains associations between data field types (date, description, price) and their target column identifiers
- **Receipt Data Field**: Represents a piece of information extracted from a receipt (such as date, description, or price) that needs to be mapped to a spreadsheet column
- **Spreadsheet Column Reference**: Represents a specific column location in the user's Google Spreadsheet, identified using standard column notation (A, B, C, etc.)
