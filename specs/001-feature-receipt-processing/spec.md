# Feature Specification: Receipt Processing Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-receipt-processing`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Feature: Receipt Processing Web App

Context:
Freelancers and small businesses need to upload receipt images, extract purchase data, and save to Google Sheets.

Requirements:
- Accept JPG/PNG uploads (≤5MB).
- Run OCR to extract: transaction date, items, total amount.
- If extraction fails, prompt user for manual correction.
- Save confirmed data as new row in Google Sheets.
- UI must support drag & drop upload and mobile devices.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Successful upload appends new row in sheet.
- Manual correction available for missing fields.
- Processing <5 seconds.
- Works in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, mobile browsers."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: When a user has authenticated with Google Sheets, how do they specify where receipt data should be written? → A: User selects spreadsheet file + specific sheet tab during initial setup (saved as preference)
- Q: When a user's Google Sheets OAuth2 token expires during receipt processing, what should the system do? → A: Re-prompt for authentication immediately; discard the extracted data and require user to re-upload the receipt after re-auth
- Q: When a receipt contains multiple itemized purchases, how should they be stored in the Google Sheets row? → A: Single concatenated string with delimiter (e.g., "Coffee; Sandwich; Water")
- Q: When Google Sheets operations fail (locked document, insufficient permissions, quota exceeded), how should error messages be presented? → A: Error code + generic message (e.g., "Error GS-403: Unable to save data")
- Q: After OCR processing completes, how long should uploaded receipt images be retained by the system? → A: Temporary storage for 24 hours, then automatic deletion

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A freelancer photographs a business lunch receipt with their smartphone. They open the receipt processing app, drag and drop (or tap to select) the image. The system analyzes the receipt and extracts the date, itemized purchases, and total amount. The freelancer reviews the extracted data, corrects any OCR errors (e.g., misread date format), and confirms. The system appends a new row to their connected Google Sheets expense tracker with all receipt details.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a receipt image (JPG, 2MB) and is connected to Google Sheets, **When** they upload the image via drag-and-drop, **Then** the system extracts transaction date, items, and total amount within 5 seconds and displays them for review.

2. **Given** OCR extraction completed with missing or incorrect data, **When** the user reviews the extracted fields, **Then** the system provides editable fields for manual correction of transaction date, items, and total amount.

3. **Given** a user has reviewed and confirmed the receipt data, **When** they submit the confirmation, **Then** the system appends a new row to the specified Google Sheets with all confirmed data (date, items, total).

4. **Given** a user attempts to upload a 6MB PNG image, **When** the upload is initiated, **Then** the system rejects the upload and displays an error message indicating the 5MB size limit.

5. **Given** a user accesses the app on a mobile browser (Chrome, Safari), **When** they interact with the upload interface, **Then** the drag-and-drop area adapts to touch input and file selection works seamlessly.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OCR completely fails to extract any data from the receipt?
  - System should display empty fields and prompt user for full manual entry with clear instructions.
- What happens when the user's Google Sheets authentication token expires during processing?
  - System MUST immediately display a re-authentication prompt. Extracted receipt data is discarded. User must complete re-authentication and then re-upload the receipt image.
- What happens when a receipt image is valid format but corrupted or unreadable (blurry, too dark)?
  - System should complete OCR attempt within 5 seconds, likely returning low-confidence or empty results, then allow manual entry.
- What happens when a user uploads a receipt with multiple items spanning different categories?
  - System MUST concatenate all items into a single string with semicolon-space delimiter ("; ") and store in one Google Sheets cell (e.g., "Coffee; Sandwich; Water").
- What happens when the Google Sheets document is full, locked, or has insufficient permissions?
  - System MUST display an error code with a generic message (format: "Error GS-{code}: Unable to save data") for all Google Sheets operation failures including locks, permissions, and quota issues.
- What happens when concurrent users upload to the same Google Sheet simultaneously?
  - Google Sheets API handles row append operations atomically. System relies on Google Sheets' built-in concurrency handling; no additional conflict resolution needed.
